      <h3 className="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-8">The motivation</h3>
      <p><strong>MyAce</strong> is focused on driving player-coach interactions. Our aim is to facilitate quality coaching through digitital technology. Currently, when players record either their matches or individual strokes they find it difficult to quickly obtain high-quality feedback from a coach. Through our development of a novel tennis platform, we will facilitate the quick and efficient feedback of player&#39;s videos.</p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-8">Our end goal</h3>
      <p>Following the release of our beta app on iOS, we will be implementing a modern, platform-independent coach portal to increase the efficiency of annotating videos. We also plan to bring this web application to mobile, welcoming non-iOS users to our platform. Through the development of our Marketplace feature, we will make professional coaching accessible to all skill levels. Think cameo, but for tennis. Imagine saying that Nadal is your tennis coach!</p>
