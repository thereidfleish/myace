-- This extension gives us `uuid_generate_v1mc()` which generates UUIDs that cluster better than `gen_random_uuid()`
-- while still being difficult to predict and enumerate.
-- Also, while unlikely, `gen_random_uuid()` can in theory produce collisions which can trigger spurious errors on
-- insertion, whereas it's much less likely with `uuid_generate_v1mc()`.

-- We try to ensure every table has `created_at` and `updated_at` columns, which can help immensely with debugging
-- and auditing.
--
-- While `created_at` can just be `default now()`, setting `updated_at` on update requires a trigger which
-- is a lot of boilerplate. These two functions save us from writing that every time as instead we can just do
--
-- select trigger_updated_at('<table name>');
--
-- after a `CREATE TABLE`.
