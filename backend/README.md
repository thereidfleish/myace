# API Specification

## Authentication

### Login

**POST /login/**

This route establishes a session given a Google OAuth token and returns a user. If the user does not exist, the user is created. A Google account may be associated with multiple user IDs as long as the user IDs have different types. Therefore it is possible for someone to be both a player and a coach.

- `type`:
  - 0: player
  - 1: coach

Request:
```json
{
    "token": "{Google OAuth Token}",
    "type": 0
}
```

Response:
- 200: User fetched.
- 201: User created.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "display_name": "{User's display name}",
    "email": "{User's email}",
    "type": 0
}
```

### Logout

**POST /logout/**

This route ends a user session. All sensitive routes will return `401` until the user's session is reestablished.

### Upload a video

**POST /uploads/**

This route returns a presigned URL, which must be used to upload a video file directly to AWS using a **POST** request.
The **POST** request to the AWS `url` must contain the specified `fields`. Furthermore, all field names
containing underscores within `fields`, such as `x_amz_date`, must be hyphenated (ex. `x-amz-date`) when uploading to AWS.
After a successful upload, the client should request to convert the media to a streamable format.
