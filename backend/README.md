# API Specification

## Authentication

**POST: /api/user/authenticate/**

This route takes an encrypted Google authentication token as the request body. It then verifies the token with oauth and
decrypts it. If the user is not in the database, they are added to it. The response then contains the user's information
(such as their display name and email), as well as all their uploads.

Request:
```json
{
    "token": "{User's ID Token}"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "uid": "{User's local id}",
    "display_name": "{User's display name}",
    "email": "{User's email}"
    "uploads":
        [
            {
                "id": "{upload id}",
                "display_title": "..."
                "tags": [
                    {
                        "tid": 1,
                        "name": "backhand"
                    }
