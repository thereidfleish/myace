# üéæ AI-Tennis Coach

*TODO:* Find new name

## The Problem 

Tennis is a highly technical sport that requires more critical feedback than other sports. This means the effort required to improve is substantially higher than other sports. The ability to receive world-class coaching at a low price needs to be accessible for players to improve rapidly.  

## Alpha ‚û°Ô∏è Beta

[Backend API Specification](backend/README.md)

### ‚åõ Timeline

- [ ] **12/27/21 - 01/03/22, Week 2** Frontend & backend integration
- [ ] **12/20/21 - 12/27/21, Week 1** Ironing out the kinks

## The Future

This alpha of our product is only the beginning. Once users begin using our alpha to upload themselves hitting certain shots, we will begin training a machine learning model that will offer automatic coaching to clients. Furthermore, we will develop a coach's version that allows instructors to annotate and offer remote feedback to their players. This dataset will further improve our ML model and the feedback clients receive. 

Utilizing the AWS suite of devices, we will train our model using highly scalable EC2 instances from data stored in our S3 bucket. This allows us to scale our backend with demand in a capital effective manner.
